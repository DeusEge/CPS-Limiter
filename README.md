## VirusTotal Scan Notice

You can view the VirusTotal scan result for this application here:  
[ðŸ”— VirusTotal Link](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/91f95472d376f2779aa0ba7836061b45fb4b13ff8a1f2e9893b9bacfdbb81e5b?nocache=1)

Please note that the scan may show **a few false positives** (currently 3).  
This is a known issue that sometimes occurs with small, niche, or unsigned applicationsâ€”especially those that interact with input devices (like mouse/keyboard hooks), timing, or system APIs.

This program does **not contain any malicious code**. The false positives are likely triggered due to:

- Use of global mouse hooks (which some antivirus engines flag as suspicious by default)
- Custom input handling or timing logic (like click limiting or automation)
- The application being unsigned or not widely distributed yet

If you have any doubts, feel free to inspect the source code yourself or compile it manually from this repository. The project is open source and fully transparent.
